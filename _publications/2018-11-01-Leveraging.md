This was my doctoral consortium abstract presented at the beginning of my PhD, outlining my research vision for integrating cognitive models into narrative planning systems. The work explores how cognitive models can determine how actions and events in narratives affect audiences, with the goal of leveraging these models in narrative planning to provide intelligent narrative plans. The research aimed to create collaborative systems where human authors could work with computational systems on narrative generation, bridging cognitive science with computational storytelling.
