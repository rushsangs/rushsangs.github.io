ShowRunner is a tool for visualizing story world execution within 3D game environments, taking abstract declarative story scripts and mapping them to game engine data elements to execute narrative actions. The system uses virtual cameras to film and present the story action to users, bridging the gap between high-level narrative planning and low-level game engine visualization. This work was developed during my time at University of Utah with my adviser R. Michael Young, focusing on creating practical tools that could bring computational narratives to life in interactive 3D environments.
