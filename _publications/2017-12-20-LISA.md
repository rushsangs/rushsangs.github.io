LISA (Lexically Intelligent Story Assistant) is an AI-powered assistive tool designed to help story writers improve their narratives through intelligent analysis and feedback. The system analyzes natural language stories to build comprehensive knowledge bases, then uses artificial intelligence to detect and highlight lexical inconsistencies, plot holes, and narrative errors in real-time. LISA goes beyond simple spell-checking by understanding story context and character relationships, allowing writers to query the system in natural language about their story elements. This work demonstrates how AI can be leveraged to create databases from narrative content and provide meaningful assistance to creative writers, representing an important step toward computational creativity tools for storytelling.
