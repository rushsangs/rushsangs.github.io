This work extends narrative planning algorithms to generate QUEST representations for story plans that include failed character actions, building on our HeadSpace system for modeling character beliefs and action failures. The paper presents computational methods for translating complex narrative plans containing failed actions into structured representations that can be used for game design and interactive storytelling.
