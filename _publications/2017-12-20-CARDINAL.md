CARDINAL is a computer-assisted authoring tool designed to help scriptwriters create and edit movie scripts through intelligent automated analysis of natural language scripts. The system provides multiple perspectives for viewing and interpreting scripts by generating different intermediate representations from the narrative text. CARDINAL creates both 2D and 3D visualizations of scripted narratives and presents character interactions in an intuitive timeline-based view, empowering scriptwriters to understand their stories from spatial and temporal perspectives. This work represents a significant advancement in computational creativity tools, bridging natural language processing with visual storytelling.
