This work introduces HeadCode, a novel coding scheme for story structure that maps directly to formal models of story generation, specifically focusing on character beliefs and the complexities that arise when mistaken beliefs lead to action failure. The research addresses a significant gap in existing story coding schemes by providing a framework that can handle failed actions and character misconceptions in narrative planning systems. This was part of my PhD work with Michael Young at University of Utah, developing more sophisticated representations for computational storytelling that could capture the nuanced psychology of character behavior in narratives.
