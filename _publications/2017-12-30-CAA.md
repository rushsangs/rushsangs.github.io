This work presents an advanced computer-assisted authoring system designed to help scriptwriters during the story-writing process through intelligent natural language analysis. The system extracts comprehensive information from natural language stories and enables both story-centric and character-centric reasoning capabilities. A key innovation is the introduction of "knowledge bytes" as atomic units of information that allow the system to parse narrative text into structured, queryable data. The system provides intuitive querying interfaces that enable scriptwriters to ask natural language questions about story and character information, leveraging logical reasoning to provide intelligent responses. This research demonstrates how AI can transform the creative writing process by making narrative information more accessible and analyzable for authors.
