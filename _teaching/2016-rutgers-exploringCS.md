This was a one-credit First-year Interest Group Seminar (FIGS) that I designed and taught to 30 first-year students over 10 weeks. The course served as both an introduction to computer science concepts and a college transition program, combining academic exploration with mentorship and community building.

Course Overview
======

**FIGS: Exploring Computer Science** was designed to support first-year students in their transition to college through intentional exploration of computer science while building connections with peers, faculty, and the broader Rutgers community. Students discovered career possibilities, learned about university resources, and engaged with fundamental CS concepts through hands-on activities and real-world applications.

The seminar met weekly for 80 minutes in an interactive, discussion-based format that emphasized participation, collaboration, and experiential learning. Rather than traditional lectures, each session combined mini-presentations, group activities, problem-solving exercises, and reflection discussions.

Innovative Teaching Approaches
======

**Hands-On Learning Activities**
- Physical puzzle-solving using programming blocks to teach algorithmic thinking
- Introduction to typical CS problems like Dining Philosophers and Tower of Hanoi 
- Hardware show-and-tell with actual computer components from the CS department's CAVE lab
- Interactive website design sessions where students created startup websites using paper prototypes
- IoT brainstorming where students designed internet-connected everyday objects
- Robotics blueprint activities using physical cubes to model robot components

**Real-World Connections**
- **CAVE Excursion**: Field trip to the Computer Science department's Collaborative Academic Versatile Environment, where students met with CS clubs (USACS, Women in CS, RU Autonomous) and saw student project demonstrations
- **Corporate Culture Analysis**: Students watched videos about Google and Apple's work environments, then designed their own ideal tech company culture
- **Peer Panel**: Senior CS students shared internship experiences, academic advice, and involvement in research and student organizations
- **Faculty Guest Speaker**: Professor Mubbasir Kapadia presented his research on crowd simulation and interactive digital storytelling

**Integration of University Resources**
Each week strategically incorporated different Rutgers services - from Career Services and academic planning with the Academic Dean, to health and wellness resources, dining services, learning centers, and multicultural communities. This helped students navigate university life while exploring their academic interests.

Curriculum Highlights
======

**Technical Topics Covered**
- Programming languages and algorithmic problem-solving
- Website development lifecycle and database systems  
- Computer systems, operating systems, and cybersecurity
- Data structures, algorithms, and Big Data processing
- Game development and interactive narrative systems
- Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics fundamentals

**Professional Development Elements**
- Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using collaborative learning circles
- Career exploration across CS domains: software development, database administration, QA testing, cybersecurity, and research
- Corporate culture and workplace wellness discussions
- Academic planning and degree navigation with university administrators

**Research and Information Literacy**
Students completed the RIOT (Research Information Online Tutorial) and learned to read academic papers in computer science. The culminating project required groups to conduct literature reviews on unsolved challenges in CS domains, presenting their findings on topics ranging from machine learning optimization to cybersecurity threats.

Assessment and Student Engagement
======

The course used a pass/no-credit grading system requiring 70/100 points, emphasizing participation and engagement over traditional testing. Assessment included:

- **Attendance & Participation** (40 points): Daily engagement in discussions and group activities
- **Assignments** (30 points): RIOT tutorial completion, event reflection paper, and "One Step Ahead" independent learning assignment
- **Final Group Project** (30 points): 6-8 minute presentations on CS domain challenges with literature review and peer evaluation components

**Student Engagement Strategies**
- Memory games and icebreakers that incorporated course content
- Collaborative problem-solving in small groups
- Peer teaching through learning circles and group presentations  
- Reflective writing connecting personal experiences to CS concepts
- Interactive polls and debates on technology topics
